# mentorship-citibike


## Description

This is a project I did during my mentorship at the Stony Brook Robotics Club. The Citi Bike Location Visualizer is a Python-based application that uses data from Citi Bike to create a visual representation of bike stations across a map. It provides an interactive map interface to help users explore the distribution of Citi Bike stations in a specific area.

## Features

- Visualize Citi Bike stations on an interactive map.
- Display station details such as location.
- Retrieve real-time data to ensure up-to-date information.
